# Daily Project Log

### August 13, 2025
* Successfully created the smart-campus-navigation repository on GitHub.

* Initialized the local project with Git and connected it to the remote repository.

* Resolved the "unrelated histories" error by merging the remote and local branches.

* Successfully pushed the initial project files to GitHub.

### August 27, 2025
* Resolved a series of critical Git errors (unable to create lock files) by identifying the issue as likely caused by an antivirus program and a corrupted Git state.

* Successfully executed the git add, git commit, and git push commands.

* Updated the README.md file on GitHub to reflect the project's new scope, which includes classroom navigation.

* Confirmed that the entire project is now fully synchronized and backed up on GitHub.

*  Began planning for the next phase of the project: collecting Points of Interest (POIs).

### October 11, 2025
* Successfully acquired high-resolution, **floor-wise images** for all targeted main campus buildings (e.g., MBA/MCA Block, Library, Ayurveda Building).
  
* Confirmed that these images were obtained from **Gururaj Sir of the Civil Department**, ensuring data accuracy for internal layouts.
  
* The acquired floor plan imagery is a critical milestone for implementing the **internal (indoor) navigation** map layers.
  
* Began planning the necessary updates to the `campusData` structure to support the new floor layers and internal mapping feature.
  
* Confirmed that the external POI coordinate data already collected aligns correctly with the main campus map's path network.
