## Project Overview
This project is a web-based campus navigation system designed to help students and visitors easily find their way around the Maharaja Institute of Technology, Mysore. It uses a custom map of the campus to provide turn-by-turn directions and locate key points of interest, from buildings to individual classrooms.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Map:** A responsive, zoomable, and pannable map of the entire campus.
- **Points of Interest (POIs):** Markers for all key buildings, labs, sports grounds, and classrooms.
- **Layered POI System:** Markers for individual rooms appear as the user zooms in on a building, preventing clutter on the map.
- **Search Functionality:** A user-friendly search bar to quickly find any location, whether it's a building or a specific classroom.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** An intelligent algorithm (like A*) to calculate the shortest path between two points.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Mapping Library:** [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
